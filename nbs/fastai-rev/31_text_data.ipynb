       "      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the xxunk possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . xxmaj in fact , all its charm is xxunk , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot … which is highly believable to xxunk . xxmaj it 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you … a feeling you do n't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart - warming they may be . \\n\\n xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik ( james xxmaj stewart ) and xxmaj clara xxmaj xxunk ( margaret xxmaj xxunk ) do n't have the most xxunk of first xxunk when she arrives in the shop ( matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . xxmaj they clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened -- he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . xxmaj their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( xxunk , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj now that xxmaj che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short xxmaj australian cinema run ( extremely limited xxunk screen in xxmaj xxunk , after xxunk ) , i can xxunk join both xxunk of \" at xxmaj the xxmaj movies \" in taking xxmaj steven xxmaj soderbergh to task . \\n\\n xxmaj it 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject , but xxmaj soderbergh 's most recent stinker , xxmaj the xxmaj girlfriend xxmaj xxunk ) , was also missing a story , so narrative ( and editing ? ) seem to suddenly be xxmaj soderbergh 's main challenge . xxmaj strange , after xxunk years in the business . xxmaj he was probably never much good at narrative , just xxunk it well inside \" edgy \" projects . \\n\\n xxmaj none of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . xxmaj as xxmaj david xxmaj stratton xxunk , \" two parts of xxmaj che do n't ( even ) make a whole \" . \\n\\n xxmaj epic xxunk in name only , xxmaj che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! xxmaj it certainly has no legs , xxunk as except for its xxunk ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk - long xxunk just goes nowhere . \\n\\n xxmaj even xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk , the more xxunk of xxmaj australia 's xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies duo , noted about xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk waste of ( xxunk digital xxunk ) : \" you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … \" . i too am surprised xxmaj soderbergh did n't give us another xxunk of xxup that somewhere between his xxunk two xxmaj parts , because he still left out massive xxunk of xxmaj che 's \" xxunk \" life ! \\n\\n xxmaj for a xxunk of an important but infamous historical figure , xxmaj soderbergh xxunk xxunk , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by \\n\\n 1 . never providing most of xxmaj che 's story ; \\n\\n 2 . xxunk xxunk film xxunk with mere xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 3 . xxunk both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; \\n\\n 4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; \\n\\n 5 . remaining xxunk episodic ; \\n\\n 6 . xxunk proper context for scenes xxrep 3 - whatever we do get is xxunk in xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 7 . xxunk xxunk all audiences ( even xxmaj spanish - xxunk will be confused by the xxunk xxunk in xxmaj english ) ; and \\n\\n 8 . xxunk xxunk his main subject into one dimension . xxmaj why , at xxup this late stage ? xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",
